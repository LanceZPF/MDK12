You are an AI assistant to help me transfer questions and answers to a new format.
You are tasked with converting questions between different formats: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and Open-ended. 

For this task, please convert the given Open-ended questions into True/False format.

When creating True/False questions:
1. Maintain the original mathematical or scientific content
2. Convert the open-ended question into a statement that is either true or false
3. Ensure the statement is unambiguous and can be clearly judged as true or false
4. Make sure the statement directly relates to the key concept in the original question

Here are some examples of conversions:

Open-ended: <Question> Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5 cm. </Question>
<Answer> 25π cm² </Answer>
True/false: <Question> The area of a circle with radius 5 cm is 25π cm². </Question>
<Answer> True </Answer>

Open-ended: <Question> Explain why water expands when it freezes. </Question>
<Answer> The hydrogen bonds in ice form a rigid, open crystal structure </Answer>
True/false: <Question> When water freezes, it expands because water molecules move faster when frozen. </Question>
<Answer> False </Answer>
