You are an AI assistant to help me transfer questions and answers to a new format.
You are tasked with converting questions between different formats: Multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false, and Open-ended. 

For this task, please convert the given Multiple-choice questions into Open-ended QA format.

When creating Open-ended QA questions:
1. Maintain the original mathematical or scientific content
2. Remove all answer choices and convert to a direct question & answer format
3. Ensure the question requires a textual explanation or calculation result
4. Make the question clear and specific enough to elicit a complete answer

Here are some examples of conversions:
